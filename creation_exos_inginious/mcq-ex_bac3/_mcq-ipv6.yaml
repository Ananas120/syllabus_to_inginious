            1. The IPv6 packet header includes several fields that are shown in the figure below.
            
            
            Among the following affirmations about the role of these different fields, only one is *incorrect*. Select the incorrect affirmation.

                A router never changes any field of an IPv6 packet that it forwards.
                
            valid: True
            feedback: |
                This affirmation is incorrect. A router changes the Hop-Limit of the packets that it forwards. It may also change other fields such as the TClass, but this is outside the scope of this ebook.
                
            text: |
                When a host sends an IPv6 packet, its HopLimit is always set to zero. Routers increment the value of this field for each packet that they forward.
                
            valid: True
            feedback: |
                This affirmation is incorrect. A host sends packets with a positive HopLimit and routers decrement this field. 
                
            text: |
                A router always decrements the HopLimit of all forwarded IPv6 packets.

                To forward a packet, a router always looksup the destination address inside its forwarding table.

            4. The forwarding tables used in an IPv6 network define the forwarding paths that are used for the packets. Consider the simple network depicted in the figure below. In this network, the hosts have the following addresses :
            
            - host ``A`` : ``2001:db8:1341:1::A`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:1::1``
            - host ``B`` : ``2001:db8:1341:3::B`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:3::3``
            
            The routers have one address inside each network :
            
            - router ``R1`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:1::1`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` on its East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::1`` on its South interface
            - router ``R2`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:12::2`` on its West interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:23::2`` on its South-West interface 
            - router ``R3`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:3::3`` on its East interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::3`` on its North-East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` on its North interface
            
            The forwarding tables of these three routers, ignoring the routes to the local interfaces, are shown in the figure below.

            5. Consider the network shown in the figure below. In this network, the following addresses are used.
            
            - host ``A`` : ``2001:db8:1341:1::A`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:1::1``
            - host ``B`` : ``2001:db8:1341:4::B`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:4::4``
            
            The routers have one address inside each network :
            
            - router ``R1`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:1::1`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` on its East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::1`` on its South interface
            - router ``R2`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:12::2`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::2`` on its South-West interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:24::2`` on its South interface.
            - router ``R3`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:34::3`` on its East interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::3`` on its North-East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` on its North interface
            - router ``R4`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:34::4`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:24::4`` on its North interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:4::4`` on its East interface
            
            The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Sometimes, these forwarding tables must be configured manually. 
            
            
            In this network, select `all` the forwarding tables below that ensure that hosts ``A`` and ``B`` can exchange packets in both directions.

            7. Consider again the same network with three routers as discussed earlier. Let us now explore how :manpage:`traceroute6(8)` operates in such a network. A key point to remember about :manpage:`traceroute6(8)` is that when it returns an ICMP message, this message is sent inside a packet whose source is one of the addresses of the router and whose destination is the source address of the packet that triggered the generation of this ICMP message. In this network, the hosts have the following addresses :
            
            - host ``A`` : ``2001:db8:1341:1::A`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:1::1``
            - host ``B`` : ``2001:db8:1341:3::B`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:3::3``
            
            The routers have one address inside each network :
            
            - router ``R1`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:1::1`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` on its East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::1`` on its South interface
            - router ``R2`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:12::2`` on its West interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:23::2`` on its South-West interface 
            - router ``R3`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:3::3`` on its East interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::3`` on its North-East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` on its North interface
            
            The forwarding tables of these three routers, ignoring the routes to the local interfaces, are shown in the figure below.
            
            
            
            
            In this network, select the all traceroute outputs that are correct according to the forwarding tables shown above.

                This traceroute is correct but note that it's likely possible that the penultimate address will be an other IPv6 address of `R1`: ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` instead of ``2001:db8:1341:13::1``, it depends if the ICMP package takes the path to the previous router or to the source (the reversed path is different according to the forwarding tables).

                This traceroute is correct but note that it's likely possible that the penultimate address will be an other IPv6 address of `R3`: ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` instead of ``2001:db8:1341:23::3``, it depends if the ICMP package takes the path to the previous router or to the source (the reversed path is different according to the forwarding tables).

            9. When an IPv6 router receives a packet to be forwarded, it finds the most specific match for the destination address of this packet in its forwarding table. Consider the following forwarding table from an hypothetical IPv6 router.
            

            .. code-block:: console

               2001:DB8:1341::/48, via nexthop1
