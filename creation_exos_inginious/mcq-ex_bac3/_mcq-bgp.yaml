            1. The BGP decision process is the process that is used by a BGP router to select the best path among all the paths learned towards a given destination prefix. The table below represents all the BGP routes learned by a BGP router and their corresponding attributes. For simplicity, the nexthops are indicated as router names instead of IP addresses.

                A BGP router always prefers the path with the shortest AS-Path. ``AS2`` has learned two paths for prefix ``2001:db8:4/48`` : ``AS3:AS4`` and ``AS1:AS3:AS4``. ``AS2`` will use the path ``AS3:AS4`` and advertise it to ``AS5``.

                ``AS5`` only learns one path from ``AS2`` : ``AS2:AS3:AS4``. It never learns the path ``AS2:AS1:AS3:AS4``

            6. Consider the same Internet as above, but now assume that ``AS2`` has configured its import filters to attach a higher local-preference to the routes received from ``AS1``. ``AS4`` announces one prefix : ``2001:db8:4/48``.
            
            
            
            Assuming that all the links are up and the network has converged, select all the correct affirmations about the state of the BGP routing tables. Assume that there are no routing policies in this Internet.

                ``AS2`` has learned two paths for prefix ``2001:db8:4/48`` : ``AS3:AS4`` and ``AS1:AS3:AS4``. The second path is longer but has a highest local-preference. ``AS2`` will use it and advertise it to ``AS5``.
