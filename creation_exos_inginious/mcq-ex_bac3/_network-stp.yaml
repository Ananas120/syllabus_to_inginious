            1. With the 802.1d protocol, Ethernet switches exchange BPDUs that contain four informations :
            
            - the `Root identifier` 
            - the `Cost` to reach the root
            - the `Transmitter identifier`
            
            The third information contains two parts : the identifier of the switch that sent the BPDU and the identifier of the port where the BPDU has been sent. Each switch uses a unique identifier for each of its ports. 
            
            
            Select among the list below *all* the BPDUs that are better than ``[R=123,C=17,T=15.4]``
