                The retransmission timer has a random part to prevent synchronisation among the communicating hosts.

                In ALOHA, a collision can occur when several hosts transmit almost at the same time.

                With persistent CSMA, a host sends its frame as soon as the communication channel becomes free.

                With CSMA, acknowledgements are not needed since each host senses whether the communication channel is free before transmitting.

                With CSMA/CD, there is no need to use acknowledgements to detect collisions.

                CSMA/CD relies on explicit acknowledgements to detect collisions.
                
            valid: False
            feedback: |
                When using CSMA/CD, the absence of any detected collision is equivalent to an implicit acknowledgement.

                When using CSMA/CD, a host must check that the communication channel is free before transmitting data.
                
            valid: True

                This is the Carrier Sense part of the CSMA/CD algorithm.
                
            text: |
                To be able to detect all collisions, CSMA/CD must enforce a minimum size for all transmitted frames.

                To be able to detect all collisions, CSMA/CD must enforce a maximum size for all transmitted frames.
                
            valid: False
            feedback: |
                Most CSMA/CD deployments use a maximum frame size, but this is not required to detect collisions. This maximum frame size is usually defined to ensure fairness and prevent communicating hosts from using the communication channel forever.
