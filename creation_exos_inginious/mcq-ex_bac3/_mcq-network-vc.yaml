            1. In a network that uses virtual circuits, the forwarding paths depend on the label tables installed inside each network node. 
            
            In this network, only one of the affirmations about the forwarding paths is correct. Which one ?

                This path is incorrect. If `A` sends a packet with `label=3`, the packet will follow the path `R1->R3->R2->R1` and return to `A`.

                This path is incorrect. If `B` sends a packet with `label=1`, the packet will follow the path `R3->R2` and will loop on link `R2-R3`

            2. The forwarding paths used in a virtual circuits network depend on the label forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Sometimes, these tables must be configured manually.
            
            In this network, which of the label forwarding tables below ensures that `A` and `B` can exchange packets in both directions.
