            1. Consider the network represented in the figure below. Assume that the
            network is using a distance vector protocol as its routing protocol.
            When the network boots, which of the following distance vectors
            correspond to the first vector
            that each router sends ? We assume that the link weights are configured on
            the routers as shown in the figure. We consider a basic version of
            distance routing without split horizon and without poisoning. What
            are all the correct distance vectors among the choices below ?

                When a distance vector router boots, it only knows itself at a distance of `0`.

            2. Consider the same network as in the previous question. The network has been running for several hours. Among the following answers, what are the distance vectors that are produced by the routers at that time ?

                A router always sends a summary of its routing table. After several hours, `R1` already knows how to reach `R4`.
