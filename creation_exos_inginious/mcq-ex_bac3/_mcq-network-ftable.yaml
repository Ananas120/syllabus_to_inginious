    Building forwarding tables
    --------------------------
    The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Consider the network shown below with the forwarding tables.
    The forwarding paths used in a network depend on the forwarding tables installed in the network nodes. Sometimes, these forwarding tables must be configured manually.

            In this network, which of the forwarding tables below ensures that both :
            
            - `A` and `B` can exchange packets in both directions 
            - the path from `A` to `B` is the reverse of the path from `B` to `A`

                There is a forwarding loop with this forwarding table. `B` cannot reach `A` because the packets that it sends loop on the `R2-R3` link.

                The path from `A` to `B` is not the reverse of the path from `B` to `A` with these forwarding tables.
